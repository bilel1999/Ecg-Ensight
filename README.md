ECG Monitoring IoT Project
Our ECG Monitoring IoT project is a web application that collects ECG signals from patients using an ECG sensor and sends the data to the website via an ESP32. The website allows patients to fill in their medical information along with the collected ECG signal, and then uses machine learning to generate results. Patients can also view a list of doctors and their contact information. Doctors can access and consult their patients through the platform.
